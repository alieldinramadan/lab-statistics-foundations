# Lab | Statistics Foundations
In this lab we are going to put into practice what we learned about the foundations of statistics. You won't need to use Python, just your brain and a little bit of *Markdown*. 

## Your task
Today you'll need to complete the challenges described below.

## Deliverables
You need to submit a markdown file with the solution to the following challenges. You can create a new *.md* file or directly edit the *README.md* to include your solutions.

## Challenges
### Challenge 1
One player rolls two dices. Describe the measurable space and the random variable for:

* A. The values that the player obtains.

(1,1), (1,2), (1,3), (1,4), (1,5), (1,6), (2,1), ............ , (5,6), (6,1), (6,2), (6,3), (6,4), (6,5), (6,6)


* B. The sum of the values obtained.

(2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9,10,11,12)


* C. The maximum value obtained after rolling both dices.

(6,6) = 12



Describe the following events:
* Case A: Both values are greater than 5.

P(x=6)=5/36

P(x=7)=6/36

P(x=8)=5/36

P(x=9)=4/36

P(x=10)=3/36

P(x=11)=2/36

P(x=12)=1/36

The sum = 5/36 + 6/36 + 5/36 + 4/36 + 3/36 + 2/36 + 1/36 = 26/36 = 13/18


* Case B: The sum of values is even.

P(x=2)=1/36

P(x=4)=3/36

P(x=6)=5/36

P(x=8)=5/36

P(x=10)=3/36

P(x=12)=1/36

The sum = 1/36 + 3/36 + 5/36 + 5/36 + 3/36 + 1/36 = 18/36 = 1/2


* Case C: The maximum is the value of both rolls.

12



### Challenge 2
One player picks two cards from a poker deck. Describe the measurable space and the random variable for:
* A. The number of figures he picks.

Measurable space = 36
Random variable = 1/36 + 1/35

* B. The sum of card values. Consider that the value of figures is 10 and the value of aces is 15.

The sum of card values = 420

* C. The number of hearts or spades he picks.

Measurable space = 20
Random variable = 1/20 + 1/19


Describe the following events:
* Case A: The number of figures in the cards the player picked is two.

36/52 + 35/51
number of cards with figures is 36 and then 4 with A and then 12 cards (kings, queens and jacks), total of 52


* Case B: The sum of card values is 17.

4/81

* Case C: The value of both cards is less than 8.

10/81


### Challenge 3
Two players roll a dice. Describe the measurable space and the random variable for:
* A. The score of player A.

Measurable space = 6
Random variable = 1/6

* B. The greatest score.

6

* C. The earnings of player A if the game rules state that:  
"The player with the greatest score gets a coin from the other player.".

1/2 of the probabilities are in player A's favor to win one coin.

* D. The earnings of player A if the game rules state that:  
"The player with the greatest score gets as many coins as the difference between the score of player A and player B.". 

the number of coins that player one gets is 
The earnings of player A = (Player A's score - Player B's score) * one coin

Describe the following events:
* Case A: The score of player A is 2.

1/6

* Case B: The greatest score is lower or equal than 2.

4/36

* Case C: Considering the case where the winner gets as many coins as the difference between scores (D), describe: 
  * Player A wins at least 4 coins.

		3/36 = 1/12

  * Player A loses more than 2 coins.

		16/36 = 8/18

  * Player A neither wins nor loses coins.

		6/36 = 1/5


## Bonus challenges
### Bonus Challenge 1
Three players take balls from a box. Inside that box there are red, blue, green and black balls. The players can take three balls at mosts with the following rules:

* If the ball is blue, they can take another ball.
* If the ball is green, they get one point and they can take another ball.
* If the ball is red, they can’t take another ball.
* If the ball is black, they lose one point and they can’t take another ball.

Describe the measurable space and the random variable for:
* A. Player A wins. Do not consider ties as a win.
* B. Player A and B get the same points.
* C. All players get 0 points.

### Bonus Challenge 2
Consider the situation of bonus challenge 1 but now with four players. Does anything change in your solutions? What are the changes in each case?

### Bonus Challenge 3
One player takes three balls from a box. Inside the box there are 5 balls: two of them are black and the other three are white. 

Describe the measurable space and the random variable for:
* A. The number of white balls if every time we take a ball we keep it.
* B. The number of white balls if every time we take a ball we put it back again into the box.
* C. The number of black balls if every time we take a ball we keep it.
* D. The number of black balls if every time we take a ball we put it back into the box.
